Provides info to site admins as to which plugins are activated sitewide, and which blogs plugins are activated on.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a snapshot view of which blogs are using any particular plugin. 

For sites that are using Plugin Commander to manage plugins, additional columns for the Plugin Commander settings of Auto Activate and User Controlled are included.

For sites that are using Plugin Manager, additional columns for the Plugin Manager settings of Auto Activate, User Controlled and Supporter Controlled are included.

Because the time to generate stats can be quite large, network plugin useage is cached and can be regenerated anytime via the "Regenerate" button.

For users of <a href="http://firestats.cc/wiki/WPMUPluginCommander">Plugin Commander</a> or <a href="http://wpmudev.org/project/wpmu-plugin-manager">Plugin Manager</a>, it also provides information on which plugins are auto activated, user controlled, or supporter-controlled (for Plugin Manager).
